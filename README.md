# 7 Days Python Mod Manager

This mod manager for 7 Days to Die was developed in 
Python with the intent to be a cross-platform solution
to managing mods when I could not find a Linux
compatible manager.

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or newer with tk installed

## Usage
- Move all mods to a mod library directory
- Edit mod.py lines 5 and 6 with a path to your library 
of mods and mod install location
- Run main.py
- Click right arrow on mods in left column to activate
- Click up and down arrow in right column to reorder
- Click left arrow on mods in right column to deactivate

## Future plans
- Mod details screen
- Mod dependencies
- Mod incompatibility flags
- Mod loadouts
